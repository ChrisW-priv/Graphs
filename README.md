# Graph project
project designed to be a general interface for any graph, no matter the implementation.

I strive to build one, universal interface to allow any graph representation to 
work and thus allow for better separation of logic and actual implementation.

## Work needed!
This is practicaly R&D project! do not use it as yours! If you want to
constribute your work pls write to me! I would love some help on this!!!

## Glosary
Vertex - node that can have relation to other nodes
[...]

## TODO
Currently, I only have an experimental design. 
I need to design interface MUCH better.

After last TODO update I decided to drop iterator support in general interface.
Instead, if users want iterator in their concrete graph, then they can add it.
I will include some template for this to allow them to copy paste boiler plate.
